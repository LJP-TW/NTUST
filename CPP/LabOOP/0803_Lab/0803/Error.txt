once upon a time there were three little pigs. when they grew up, they LEFT
THEIR parents to live their FIRST winter by themselves. autumn came and it began RAINing. 
tHE three little pigs started to feel they needed a real house to live in. they talked 
ABOUT how to build a house and prepare for the coming WINter, but each decided for himSELF.
